       "  \"i mentioned earlier an experience i had with a skirt that got my mom all in a tiff , and i think it may have left me in a bit of a precarious position ... im not trans-sexual , ill just get that out of the way right now ... and though i can be rather feminine sometimes , im not gay either , i used to wonder if perhaps i was bi ... but for the most part guys are pigs and though some are attractive , i wouldnt date them , it just seems off to me . growing up with a lesbian mother has givin me a gift of open mindedness so i have absolutely nothing against gays lesbians bi or trans-gender/sexual people , but i guess it just isnt for me . however , i am open to new things , almost anything ( i find it ironic i have been raised in such an open and alternitive home and yet i am being accosted for looks and womens clothes ... hmmm ) and i like close fitting clothes . so ... eventually a time came where i had the , oppurtunity , to wear this really litle pink shirt that said `` i kiss boys '' in really glittery letters . my friend liz and poppy bought it for me and so just for the hell of it i wore it to school one day . i go to a pretty rockin school and so i didnt get any shit , and this shirt was small ... like mid driff and just the whole deal , yeah some guys looked at me wierd , but i actually got s lot of compliments , and this started a chain reaction of sorts . a few days later , another female friend of mine gave me yet another small pink shirt , and , again i wore it at school , same reaction pretty much , oh if you want to see what i look like , to try and imagine me in a pink shirt ( who wouldnt want to imagine a guy in a small pink shirt ? ? ) there are pictures of me in an online photo album at : http : //www.sonoma.edu/users/n/niemann/travels/travels.html so anyway this pink tradition lasted for a few more shirts , and then it died . but now i , when the time came , would be ready for the next step . **bum bum bumm** the next step came a few weeks later when i was hanging out with some friends of mine ( and this kind of random guy that was a friend of my friend ) and we all decided , ( well me and wei decided ) to dress me and n*** up in girl clothes and go to a local chill cafe and walk around and make idiots of ourselfs ... ( sounds like fun ... eh ? ) so we did and we had a ball , it was like 10:00 pm so it was dark and stuff , it was just really cool and funny ... lots of fun . now about the skirt in the car my mom found , this was the first ( and only ) skirt i had ever worn , it was my friend liz 's and she gave it to me as a gift , to remember and all that jazz . so yeah i wore that to the cafe with my friends and had jenn hold onto it because i had to leave right when we got back ( i have an 11:00 pm curfew ) and she had it at her house for weeks afterwards . when she gave it back to me i left it in the car and my mom found it ... of course she found it 2 days after our fight with the eyeliner , and so i walk in the door at 11:15 with eye liner on and my mom had this skirt ... doesnt look to good . so its ok i guess , now she just sees me as a twisted trans-gender fairy freak crank user , its all good , im happy with who i am , its a lil ironic because im not really any of those things . oh well . she 'll get it some day . sorry this was so bloody long ... \",\n",

'' quixtar ? or bww ? my upline or my sponsor ? i would be objective here : quixtar they are basically a portal on which people build their businesses . i actually do n't have any beef with them . i 'd try to be even more objective , so here it goes : pros excellent products : they are 20-50 % more expensive but it was upline + bww push to do 300pv , not them . they even have average ibo income stated and have 50 pv retail rule . good old shoppers drug mart is also quite expensive , so i do n't have a problem here . customer service : i have not received better customer service anywhere else ! their buy back guarantee is awesome , i ’ ve returned a lot of items : ) cons they turn a blind eye to all the abuses done by bww and other motivational organizations . in their response to the nbc dateline segment , they defended themselves , not bww or other qmos ( quixtar motivational organizations ) while no one actually attacked them ! they refused to appear on dateline show , while they were given a chance , and put a recorded response way before the dateline show was even aired . i do n't know why they are hiding ? they should enforce mlm rules more strictly . but as ken mcdonald said to bo short , `` what would happen to the business '' bww urllink ( britt world wide ) pros learned public speaking , people skills learned very good teachings from books cons an qmo , responsible for doing some not-so-legal stuff i.e . moving a product that has no end customer , like tapes / books / seminars . their representatives sucked me in , and 'motivated ' me to waste money in expensive products . i have a pile of tapes sitting on my home , full with hype and bashing everything other than the `` system '' . average cost to be a core : $ 60 sto + $ 24 opens + $ 100 / month ( 6 trips to us , one trip cost at least $ 200 ) + 300 pv = > $ 650 extra ( 300 pv is actually $ 750 but i subtracted $ 100 i saved by avoiding wal-mart ) + $ 50 extra fuel + $ 21 kate + $ 10 website = $ 915 / month and my upline said how one could loose money in this business ! priceless ! ( $ 915 x 9 months ! ) upline well , i wo n't talk about my personal experiences with them . if some of my relatives read it , it would be hard for me to refrain them from getting physical against that dude . i 'll picture a general , business view of them . pros drove several time from us to canada for me worked on my prospects spent time talking / yelling at me cons make me spent $ 900 ish a month , including push for seminars , tapes , leadership tapes and put order on 30th , which is still stocked . i ’ ve left more than a year now ! i was not told the number and cost of conferences , sto , traveling involved . i should 've known so i could make an informed decision . brainwashed , or try to brainwash me that system is only thing good in the world , rest is pure evil . put religion second , business first attitude . when i told i quit , kept talking to me on phone for 1.5 hours while i was at the office and he was at home called me several time on my cell , resulting huge bill , despite my request not to told me ftc approved this business . ftc never stamp on any business , it just has some guidelines . bww violates some of them ! sponsor pros never pushed me to sign me in , never begged me not to quit always calm , cool and nice helped me on daily basis lend me lit packs , books and tapes cons lied to me , by giving impression that they are making profit . i really doubt they are making any profit to date , which at least covers their expense . there were $ 5k worth of tapes in their guest room last time i saw ! i was not told the number and cost of conferences , sto , traveling involved . i should 've known so i could make an informed decision . when i quit , they told me after a month that i was not doing business properly . dude ! i was with you at least one hour daily for a year , why did n't you tell me then ? i did whatever you told me ! i have asked about the tools , i don ’ t know if i could return them . that will be the real test of character . i 've yet to see ! so it turns out , i 've a beef with qmo , i.e . bww , not exactly with quixtar . well a little with quixtar . bww need to make training free and easy . people should n't have to spend so much time and money on 'training ' . free mp3s on net , no seminars will make it much feasible . my system expenses should not be more than $ 30 a month . also retail should be taught to ibos and should be necessary . self consumption should be discouraged . in fact , 70 % of the products should be retailed , as ftc said ! \",\n",

( 100pv is shown in the plan ) 65.6 % of ibos never once attained 100 personal pv in the previous 11 months . 21.5 % of ibos had a ditto delivery profile only 1.9 % of members and clients had ditto delivery profiles . the average pv point cost $ 2.70 . and on the same site : urllink http : //amquix.info/amway_directly_speaking.html rich devos said : now , the tape business , if it is not used as a support for the amway business , will oftentimes be an illegal business -- in fact , it could be called a pyramid -- because , d -- does not get sold to the consumer . which means that all the tape business does is take money out of the organization , and because the final person ca n't retail it , it never brings money into the organization . now , i 'm not arguing about the value of it -- we accept the fact that motivation is vital to this business . good , honest motivation is important to the business . but , it must be motivation that builds the business -- not become a business in itself . \",\n",
       "  \"yes , what exactly is wrong with the system ( of quixtar tm , e.g . bww tm ) ? it gives people opportunity to make money . if some one hasn ’ t been successful , s/he should change some thing . after all : businesses work , people do n't ok here is what ’ s wrong . quixtar system , in my opinion , is not completely in accordance with ftc rules . `` system '' teaches it that way . please read ftc site . urllink http : //www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/pyrdalrt.htm and more : urllink http : //www.amquix.info/tod_faq.html in a nutshell , here are my concerns : not so legal activity 1 : does every ibo meet the 50 pv retail rule ? my upline told me to report 50 pv as retail . did i `` retail '' 50 pv , no ! i was told to lie . not so legal activity 2 : in pyramids , a product , which has no value outside the pyramid , should not be sold to participants . what about the `` system '' ? how many retail customers will buy tapes ? quixtar saves its ass by saying it is optional , but `` system '' tells so is success , and one must be on standing order to show their seriousness . and seminars , oh man ! try to be in good books of your upline while not attending them . not so legal activity 3 : if i am behind my quota , i should not be receiving call from some upline to complete my order . i ca n't retail in last hour ! i 'll end up stocking . stocking = > illegal ! ! i 've received such calls . and after a year of quitting , i still have those stocked products , along with the pile of tapes . i lost time and money in bww tm / quixtar tm . am i alone ? nope ! there are 40 million ppl who have joined and left quixtar tm / amway tm in last 40 years . there are 400,000 active ibos in north america . how many of them are making money ? i am talking about the profit section of their income tax return , not the net income box . and here is the best : it is a urllink negative some game . at any given time , this quixtar / bww pyramid as a whole is losing money . how the top dudes make money ? by product movement and system push to their downline . what is the average income of an active ibo ? according to quixtar , $ 115 . and it is a net profit , including bonus coming from one ’ s own shopping . what is the average expense of the system ? sto + expensive self consumed products + seminars + gas + baby sitting etc . lets say $ 300 , a very conservative figure . how these guys pay for it ? ironically , jay oh bee . so what is “ system ” doing ? sucking money into it . as a whole , at any give time , whole organization is losing money . as there are some expenses going outside the system , e.g . travel etc . \",\n",
       "  \"today , i contacted an ibo . i asked him a question : `` hey buddy , do you know quixtar was on tv '' . he said yeah i watched it . then he asked me `` are you in quixtar '' ? i said no , i quit . he asked `` because of this tv segment ? '' and he said he is sorry that my life is controlled by tv etc . and i should see quixtar facts blah blah and listen to all the responses . one thing really pissed me off when he said there is a lot of negative converge about islam as well on tv . will you quit islam as well ? i had no intention of getting into a debate when i asked him . i just found that segment hilarious . but this ridicules comparison of islam made me say that please do n't compare apples with ... blue sky . there is no comparison . to the all positive people out there , who want to argue with me about tv credibility , please : 1 ) refrain yourself from giving this ridiculous example of religion vs. quixtar when we talk about media coverage . my upline have told me that exact line , it ’ s a typical quixtar programmed talk . i could answer it very well . i ’ ve seen negative sites about religion . they did not shatter my beliefs a single bit . i saw negative sites about quixtar , and more i read , more i ’ m convinced that it ’ s an illegal scam . so what it is ? some sites working some not working ? actually it ’ s not the sites or tv but it ’ s the god damn content there that matters ! ! but his example is so absurd that i may give you a psychiatrist ’ s card you if you say it one more time ! it ’ s like comparing moon light with bud light or apple with mount everest . let me give you a better example . compare business with business . ask me there is a lot of crap about microsoft , why i am still using microsoft products ? answer being : microsoft products , as evil as they are , are still more feasible to me than other software out there . they do , well almost do what they are suppose to do , i.e . deliver the promise . i may not be the happy customer but i am their customer , and i ’ ll continue to learning microsoft technologies as long as they help me do my work . as simple as that . here is a lesson for you in the above example , quixbots : there is nothing in the world that is perfect , even near to perfection . there are flaws in every invention , limitations in every creation . it is a principle . fight with me , don ’ t fight with a principle . how can you be sure that quixtar is perfect ? your upline is always right ? it doesn ’ t make any sense . 2 ) don ’ t assume i am fighting with you dude , i just asked you have you seen this video or not , and you challenged my religious beliefs by your ridiculous example ! its shows some un-security on your side , doesn ’ t it ? ask me some question about my company , i.e . how stupid our site is . i ’ d laugh with you ! even i ’ ve made that site ! 3 ) don ’ t defend yourself by attacking credibility of media . when did i say tv or internet is all true ? it never was and probably never will be . almost all news are biased , every body gives them a spin . does it mean every thing they say is false ? nope . does it mean i am saying that media is always right ? not really ! all i ’ m saying is be objective about the facts in front of you and use your brain ! for the record , i quit without reading any negative site and dateline story was aired a year after i quit . i just saw my gains and losses and where was i after a year . 4 ) i know many lines of quixtar : i ’ ve used them and i ’ ve been in the q-business . i may not have getting new teachings but are there really new teachings ? 5 ) please understand , i don ’ t get any pv for spreading negative . i don ’ t get any pat on the back from any upline by pulling you out . go ahead and spend all you ’ ve got . you know your odds ? oh you don ’ t ? 99 % chances are you ’ ll be out in 2-5 years . wan na bet ; ) 6 ) please don ’ t tell me to never complain as i was given an opportunity blah blah . there are 400 , 000 active ibos in north america and i bet you every body will be happy to sign me up ! your tone will change the moment i say ok sign me up . won ’ t it ? now let me tell you some facts about dateline story , quixtar response and quixtar facts . urllink response to quixtar 's response to the dateline exposé of may 7 , 2004 by lindy and vicki mack btw i know this guy lindy , via internet . i discuss with him on almost daily basis in neutral discussion about quixtar please read it first then talk to me . i ’ ve listened to every video you asked in urllink http : //www.quixtarfacts.com and i ’ m impressed with their ability to dodge the complaints . btw they were given an opportunity to participate in dateline . why didn ’ t they do it ? why they video tape them and put it online , like cowards . they were hiding the questions , weren ’ t they ? \",\n",

       "  \"the next meeting of the dbsa of northwest indiana will be a speaker meeting . dr. mary zemansky will be joining us to discuss how to better organize the compartments of the brain . it should be a beneficial discussion for anyone that needs a little more memory and a better functioning brain . i ca n't imagine anyone who could n't benefit from that . dr.zemansky is in practice with dr. robert walsh in chesterton at comprehensive psychology services , pc . she also lectures at ivy tech . it will be an informative and educational discussion and i hope you will join us . if you are unable to attend you will find a summary of the lecture on dbsa blogspot the next day . please do n't forget to join us for the lively discussion group for teens and young adults on the second and fourth tuesday 's of the month . encourage the young people in your life to join us , even if they do n't suffer from depression or bipolar disorder , it is a chance to get together with others and talk about what is important to them . i would be remiss if i also did n't remind you to join the group in merrillville on july 12 and 26 for their regular discussion meetings . keep and eye on this site for an interesting article about people who are addicted to suicide . it is in the works and should be here in the next few days . see you at a meeting . \",\n",
       "  \"last night i was n't sure how the topic of the support group meeting would apply to me . tom isakson was with us and the topic was `` homeless in porter county . '' how could i really relate to the homeless situation ? i donate money to shelters , i pass on clothing and hygiene products . i have empathy for the homeless , but when i see a person with a cardboard sign asking for my money while they smoke a cigarette all i really feel is disgusted . why do n't they get a job ? they are in front of mcdonald 's whose `` help wanted '' sign is clearly visible . i almost did n't attend this meeting and that would have been a tragedy because tom isakson opened my eyes to a side of homelessness that i had not seen . it was an enlightening experience . i learned that the fastest growing population of homelessness in our area are families . approximately 300 children in our area go to bed each night not knowing where they will sleep tomorrow or the next night . 150 of these children are under the age of six . there are about 750 people without a home in porter county each year . this number continues to grow . there are three basic types of homelessness . the first being chronic homelessness . these people are often homeless for a long time . these are the people we typically think of when we hear the word `` homeless . '' they often dress in rags , eat from dumpsters , and live in squalor . there are four primary reasons that we , as a group , were able to list for chronic homelessness . 1 . chronic sever mental illness . without medication these people are unable to get help . 2 . substance abuse/gambling addiction . gov't cuts have made it more difficult for these people to get the help they need to recover . 3 . duel diagnosis . both sever mental illness and substance addiction . 4 . post traumatic stress disorder . these people have suffered such trauma that they are unable to deal with life . they have no hope and no will to live . they could be war veterans , domestic violence victims , suffered the tragic death of a loved one or a child , or the collapse of their business . i ca n't help but wonder if this population will grow as soldiers return from iraq as it did when our forces returned from vietnam . next we have one time homelessness . people often bounce back from this type of homelessness . the causes for one time homelessness could effect any of us . 1 . fire 2 . divorce 3 . domestic violence/trauma 4 . natural disasters 5 . joblessness . people living paycheck to paycheck without savings . i remember seeing a tv program once that said `` we are all three paychecks away from being homeless . '' with that in mind , this could be any of us . last we have episodic homelessness . this is the largest growing category and the one that includes the most children . 1 . living from friend to friend , never knowing where the next bed will be . 2 . may get ahead for a while and then slip , never really attaining stability . a . bad luck b . chronic illness . off and on physical , mental , or medical disability that effects their work ability . c. low wages . at $ 5.15 an hour you need work a 107 hour week to afford the average apartment . d. single parenting/unpaid child support . the district attorney 's office just ca n't keep up . e. life skills deficits . usually money management issues are the biggest problem . a. impulsive spending . often the result of illness such as bipolar disorder . b . emotional control/poor anger management . not able to control their anger and keep a job or getting in trouble with the law for fighting . c. poor impulse control . calling in sick because they feel like it or not showing up on time . d . poor or low education . no post graduate education or trade school . no job training . e. dysfunctional families . most adults that go through the shelter had dysfunctional families . these people lived with abusive , alcoholic , or non-existent parents . the most important job of a parent is to teach a child that they are loved . this does n't cost anything and anyone can do it . we could all work toward ending the dysfunctional family in america by simply teaching love . the second thing we can all do is promise to be the very best friend to our friends that we can be . ask what we can do to help in a time of loss or crisis . do n't desert them when the worst appears to be over . hang in there and be a friend for the long haul . tom has some definite thoughts about what america needs to do to help stop homelessness . raising the minimum wage to make it a wage that people could actually live on . employers need to stop hiring part-time workers that they do n't have to pay benefits to . welfare is the only gov't fund that has not seen a cost of living increase since 1985 . more and more jobs are done by robots and computers or outsourced . homelessness is increasing by 5 % a year in porter county alone . the spring valley shelter ( a shelter for families ) is only able to provide shelter to about 12 % of those who ask for help due to their small size . the only other gov't owned housing in porter county is the hospital and the county jail . christian community action is trying to raise $ 1,750,000.00 to build and support a bigger shelter . this campaign is called `` raise a roof . '' if you can help with a tax deductible contribution please contact the cca at urllink ccaopc @ netnitco.net or by phone at 219-548-2379 . the shelter could also use contributions of clothing , food , toys , books , bedding items , and volunteers . if you can help contact tom isakson , program director , at urllink springva @ netnitco.net or call 219-465-1022 . the cca motto is housing for today . hope for tomorrow . remember that every little bit helps . \",\n",
       "  \"it may seem hard to believe and for some it is very difficult to discuss . it is however true . there seems to be a new mental health phenomenon . suicide for the overwhelming thrill it can give to take life to the edge of death and live to tell about it . many leave behind loved ones to tell their story and struggle to understand the obsession . it is mostly young women who are suffering from this `` addiction to suicide '' . most of these young woman suffer from depression , bipolar disorder or some other form of a mood disorder . some are just attention seeking in the most desperate way possible . like cutting , which has reached epic proportions among young women , suicide is a way to ease the pain that life often brings . for the parents who may not be familiar with the term `` cutting , '' it is when a person inflects pain on themselves by cutting into their skin with almost anything you can think of . it can also be burning oneself with a cigarette or other ways of torture , that we ca n't even imagine . teens tell me that `` cutting '' relieves their pain or enables them to feel pain . it also puts them in control of the pain they feel . most say they do it in private and are careful to mark places others wo n't see . the attention seekers often cut where you can see and want you to take notice . unlike males that often seek far more successful means of suicide such as guns , knives , and hanging , these females often choose less drastic forms of suicide . it is not that they are not serious , but that the thrill is getting as close as they can without crossing that limit . taking just enough pills and then calling 911 for help . remembering at the last second that they promised to call their therapist before attempting suicide again and making that call . some do succeed and then the thrill ends their life . it is a very high price to pay for the rush of death . this is a day and age where everything is `` now '' and `` want . '' we no longer need things or wait for them . death is no different . these young people have tried all the risk taking they can think of . the thrill is just no longer achievable . there are n't any more cries for attention that have not been tried , heard , and ignored . now there is only the rush of suicide . we ca n't ignore this desire to die because often they do succeed . we should never , not take a suicide threat seriously because you only get one chance to make a mistake . the price you pay is the life of someone you love . if you know someone who mentions suicide as a thought they have entertained , talk about it and help them to get the professional help they need . it may be an uncomfortable conversation . discussing it does not make it more likely to happen , but not talking about it can . \"],\n",

'' i did n't respond then because he had a point and i did n't want to address it without thinking about it first . so i walked away from the restaurant thinking about sexual mores and how the same intention or idea coming from different sexes can have such radically different associations . and i thought : pete , the reason why we react differently is because we know that if a man really wants to fuck a woman , he can . all he has to do is get a decent hard on and force her . sadly , when we as a society think of a man 's sexual need , we think of the violence that can be associated with it . however , when a woman wants a man , be it her son or a stranger or whatever , there is no way she can force it on him . the only thing she can do is manipulate him emotionally or psychologically , and even that allows the man to make a choice . in other words , the difference between a man 's need and a woman 's need for sex is that a woman relies on a consenting partner and a man does not . so pete , until men stop ramming their cocks into people who do n't want their holes plugged , we will always equate male sexuality with violence , even if only on the subliminal level . \",\n",

       "  \"psych , part vi tuesday , april 4th i need to catch up since friday . when i saw s. she suggested a book to get to read which i picked up last night . i feel a little funny about reading like somehow if i read it i wiil get in on some kind of secret and i wo n't get better . saturday we did some cleaning . it was really nice out and while peter and garrett ran errands i got a little gardening done and i read two chapters for class . over the weekend i decided i will accept a place in the master 's program at uconn . saturday night we went to mom and dad 's for dinner and cake and coffeee . i got some very nice things . sunday we went out to dinner with my parents and p. 's bothers and dad and e. it was very nice . i did n't think i would like it as well as i did . p. did some very nice things for me this weekend . i just wish i could be better for him . yesterday i was very agitated all day . i did get some work done and at home i picked up a bit and did laundry . i also did the grocery shopping . while i was shopping i bought razorblades . i was a little nervous about buying them , i thought someone would know what they were for , but just having thme made me feel better , like i had some control back . i did cut myself , i 'll have to be careful , because they cut very easily . today , i am feeling better than i did yesterday . i am a bit self-conscious about my arm because i am wearing something short-sleeved , but noone has said anything . i am a bit worried about what will happen when i go see dr. p. on thursday . i am going to try to make arrangements in case i have to go back to the hospital . it 's somewhat comforting to thnk about going back but i would n't want all that medication again . i 'll just have to see what happens . saturday , april 8th i have n't been taking time for myself or writing everyday . i cut myself again on tuesday night . garrett had gone to visit with a. i cut pretty deep and it took me about 15 minutes to get it to stop bleeding . on wednesday , the school nurse put a butterfly bandage on it . when i went to see dr. p. on thursday he made a good point . i cut myself because i was angry because i could n't get things done for p. and g. but cutting myself did not make that better . i gave him the blades and felt safer . on friday s. pointed out that cutting was an addiction like a drug . even though they wer both right i still have wanted to cut myself and today i felt like killing myself . i am feeling better-the thoughts are not constand but they do come and go . if i cut myself again i am supposed to write down the `` trail '' of thoughts that lead to cutting . when we got home from the pinewood derby i had a snack then went for a bike ride . it was really hard getting up the hill and now it is too windy and p. will come get me but it did help the bad feelings go down a bit . sometimes i feel like a little kid . i passes a student who graduated in january . as i passed her i thought how mature and stable she seems . even at school i always felt that she was the adult and i was the child . i really envy her . i have tried to pinpoint what makes me feel so bad but i just start thinking about one thing and it leads to another until it is too overwhelming and i feel like i ca n't stand it anymore . my mother asked if she could talk to s. about what i have . i have n't told her the new diagnosis , i do n't really want to . i feel very ashamed of it , like i ca n't control myself like other adults do . i felt bad for s. this week . she seemed to have a busy week and seemed tired . i felt bad telling her all this stuff since she had such a week . i feel like i am always complaining and never finding anything good but there to be some good things . this morning as we were leaving foxy climbed a tree to catch something and then jumped down again . it was pretty funny to watch . she 's really a good cat and spends a lot of time with me . skittles is good too but she is much more independent . it has felt good sitting in the sun all day . i stopped by the stream on the way up and listened for a while . it was very soothing and i was tempted to take my shoes and socks off and put my feet in because the water did n't feel too cold . i just saw someone i know ( but do n't recognize ) with her two boys ( about 2 ) . a wave of darkness came over just like earlier today at the derby with all those people seeming so happy and normal like i want to be again ! nobody has any idea how bad i feel and none understand . i just want to know that this will get better ! wednesday , april 12 the week has not been good . i am finding it more difficult to concentrate on anything . monday i went shopping and bought more razors . today has been the first day i have really felt like cutting myself . on monday evening i spent about an hour with my ativan debating whether or not to take it . i felt there were few things left to do . i am more prepared today . i am still not sure i have enough to do more than put me ina comea-i was angry with dr. p on monday because he only gave me 14 . i got more reading done and have completed my application acceptance . however i do n't believe i will be able to do my presentation next week as scheduled . since g. stated taking his allergy medicine he seems much better . he is sleeping better and his attitude is better . p. is getting nervous about work again . they will have a meeting on friday when he will find out what is going on . i did n't handle that as well as i would have liked last time and this time i am not sure i can handle it all . i feel like everything at home is back to normal except me . i do n't wnat to have to think about things like the bills , insurance , etc . it 's just all too frustrating . and then i come to work and feel like i do little . i am not really teaching . i doubt i am affecting any of the kids . i know i should n't cut but right now it is the only way i can feel better . i do n't know what i 'll do at s. 's today . if i tell her she will take these things from me and i wo n't have control again . r. said he thought if i killed myself that god would still love me but he thought i would have be held accountable for what happened here . i do n't think it would be too bad here-people would get along without me . i just want to leave a few instructions so things go smoothly . thursday , april 13 i am back at natchaug which is good because i feel safe . i know that i ca n't really follow through on thoughts of hurting myself . i 'm angry with myself for not following through and i am still having trouble with givving s. the pills . right now it is nice just to sit and not have to think . friday , april 14 they have let me off constant observation so i will be able to go down and get dinner and go out on the unit i met with dr. s today and along with changing my meds ( again ) he also said a couple of things which seemed to make sense and have put a little twinge into me . first he said that it sounded like i was feeling a little sorry for myself and he 's right . he also said i have to work on getting better . he said it wo n't be easy , but i have to do it . i guess the first thing made more of an impression . i need to adapt to things and get going or i will never be back to where i used to be or maybe i do n't want to be and that 's the whole point . \",\n",

'' others might call them hallucinations . i have had these for years even before i was diagnosed . some are pleasant-beautiful flowers growing from the walls , some are horrible-individuals intent on harming me , my husband , or my son . last nights were of the latter . i only remember one , it was a glowing , writhing , colorful knot at the end of the bed which i could not get by without getting hurt . i have a very good husband who helps me wake up and calm down . i do n't usually tell others about these , because they might think i was really off my rocker . when i finally woke up this morning i was sick to my stomach with a headache and fever , i 'm hoping it was all a result of the fever . i recently discovered a website where sterling silver ribbon pins can be purchased . wearing these help raise awareness of mental illnesses and how common they are .

       "\"jenny kissed me when we met , jumping from the chair she sat in ; time , you thief , who love to get sweets into your list , put that in ! say i 'm weary , say i 'm sad , say that health and wealth have missed me , say i 'm growing old , but add , jenny kissed me . ~leigh hunt~  that 's where i went today with my mom , one of the best days i 've had since coming back . i love the city . i love that city . so , we headed down ( compliments of my driving , naturally ) and after visiting my great grandma at her `` older-people 's home '' ( which was so nice , she 's such a sweetly forgetful queen ) we headed up to the heart of toronto , via queen st. east . then drove by the university i want to go to next year ... if i 'm accepted . and around that area , checking out possible houses and stuff , since i wo n't be living in residence ( that university has none ) and i wo n't be living at home ( commuting is not an option ) . i was so excited to see where i 'll hopefully be in a year . i 'm so excited to start `` life '' ! ( or mine at least ) and then we went up to spadina and kensington area , which is one of my favourite parts of toronto ( plus the harbourfront , memories ... and queen street west ) , checking out stores/deals/whatever . we found an excellent wok for none-other-than japanese cooking , and an excellent knife just cuz we need a new one . then we just wandered in and out of stores on spadina , which is incredibly close to my aunt 's condo , and my cousin 's , but he 's in yokohama right now . we also drove past my ( different ) uncle 's house and cafe . my family is awesome . anyways , we checked out some sweet textile stores , and asian food stores . not to mention , my favourite , a japanese store , with everything shipped straight from there . it was crazy to walk in and see all the products , edible and not , that i 'd spent the last year familiarizing myself with , it almost seems more 'normal ' to me than some canadian foods . so we bought some , pocky , and continued on our way ... which lead to a wicked art store , where i bought a cute little palette , cheap but handy . this summer i want to experiment with oils . i 've already got some books from the library and we 'll see how it goes . anyone want to volunteer to model ? actually , i work better from photos anyways . i ca n't stop thinking about university , but i 'm not even accepted ... i have n't even applied , wait , not even in grade 12 ... aaaah , all this excitement energy better be focused into making a sweet portfolio . and if i do n't get accepted at choice a , then i 'll hopefully get accepted somewhere else . i can be a light anywhere . righteo then , sometimes i wish i had a british accent , or australian , like back in the day ... oh well , i could always pick it up again when australians visit my house this summer ( old old friends , i 'm so excited for that too ! ) . excited is my theme . in life . ( imoto e , sore wa watashitachi no jodan desu ! ) and now for the reason i titled this post what it is titled . after being in a single culture country for so long , i appreciate toronto 's ( insert adjective here that i ca n't think of cuz all that 's in my head is japanese-tatoeba kono tango : hontou ) multiculturalism . i was in a store where the asian ( korean to omou ) storekeeper was conversing with an european ( i thought she was scandinavian ) customer , both talking in english , both with thick accents from wherever they were from , both understanding the other perfectly and the whole situation seeming so natural to me . we take it for granted cuz we grow up with situations like that . i really appreciate our spectrum of cultures . i am a part of it . excited !  is the day on which i will finally see my brother ! who i have n't seen in a year , might i add . yaaay , except he 's only home for 5 days before he leaves for his summer courses . he leaves on the 6th day . i knew it last year , but it did n't seem for real till this year . my `` full family '' life is over . from now on ( well , last year on ) my brother is constantly going to be away save for holidays . and this is my last year at home , but i 'm so excited to get out , no disrespect , but having life away from home is awesome . ( see last year ) . and we 're going to be all over the globe . cuz that 's how i want to be , always traveling . this is my list : japan ( mou ikkai ) ; europe-including england , scotland , france , italy , greece , spain , sweden ; and i want to go to papau new guinea , and fiji . we 'll see how many i actually get to . oh yeah , and korea ( as in south ) . lalala , today was productive . it 's always the productive days that make me feel the fullest at the end of it . tomorrow will be productive also . and on sunday : church ! second time this year ... this month ... i always post at night . i wonder if i blogged in , say , the morning , if i would have a different attitude ... less `` night-y '' ? omoshiroi ! haha i ca n't keep a steady stream of thought , i 'm going to bed . oyasumi nasai .  `` ... we spent so much time in the same room and i never uttered a word to her ... ''  i just watched a program on cbc called `` screw the vote '' ... some random guy who went all over canada to ask 18-34 year olds why they do n't vote . the number one reason being that `` our votes do n't count '' . ( note : by saying 'our ' i mean 'their ' because i wo n't be 18 till august ... unfortunately ) . so , they had some interesting things to say . one girl/lady from montreal ( an artsy type ) said if she was american she would vote , just because she 'd either really like or really hate bush . she would have a reason to vote . the american president , regardless of your personal opinion of him , causes a reaction in most people , thus creating the desire to either support or not , vote or vote for someone else . canada 's pm is n't known for being especially charismatic or anything , just kinda a middle-of-the-road guy . if he was someone who caused reaction in people , ( ex . pierre trudeau ) , he/they would have more younger people voting . to omou ( i think ) . that is one of my opinions on this , not that i can affect anything until august , after the election . this makes me want to run for something , just to try to change the system . maybe one day i will , after i become legal age ...  a year late . i guess you 're right , dan , in saying a year late related to what . there is no late , as long as there is no comparison , and i guess i 'm actually graduating `` on time '' but just a different time . sweet . if i had n't gone to japan i would be missing alot of experiences . not to mention that 's where i decided what i want to `` pursue '' after graduation . art . i 'm so excited for life right now . life in general . this summer will be sweet , next year doing grade 12 with sweet classes , and i 'm so hyped for applying to university , and hopefully being accepted at the one i want to get into . and excited for going back to japan , hopefully in 2 years . and excited for getting a job . excited about being back with [ canadian ] friends . my family , excited to see my brother on monday ( getting back from scotland ) . excited . but why this excitement ? why is everything so peachy keen ? i will tell you . it 's because i 'm excited about god . he 's the one who has given me so much peace about my future goals ( art ... ) . he 's the one who has given my life purpose , and a purpose i 'm excited about . like a cycle . everytime i hear a worship song , i am just excited because i know he has a purpose for me , my time here on earth . and i 'm so excited to be back having good times , good conversations , with my christian friends . encouraging each other , questioning , praying for each other , laughing ; this is what i missed in japan . this is a real life . and i know it 's just begun . watashi wa mada juunana sai desu , kore made wa hajime dake . kore kara wa tanoshimi desu yo .  this was the first year i 've ever picked courses and not had a conflict . i appreciate that . so , the verdict is ... no commencement . until 2005 , that is . i ca n't take english during summer school cuz i have my g2 test on the first day of the classes , and i ca n't transfer japanese credits as easily as once thought . apparently , if you go on an exchange out of `` free will '' ( as opposed to being `` forced '' ? ) your credits do n't count for much , unless you have some sort of test score or other internationally recognized official document saying that you can speak another language . so , luckily , i was n't counting on those credits to graduate , and it looks like i 'll just have to paste my picture to the wall beside all your graduating photos , and have my real photo a year later . oh well . but the happy news , is that i love my classes next year . i love school ... sememster i : -drawing/painting -writer 's craft ( online ) -world history -biology semester ii : -weight training -english -visual art -chemistry and all i have to do is actually hand in my 40 hours and i get my diploma . and a gifted certificate . and then i commence . a year late .  i type , post and write in this blog just because i like to have somewhere to put all my thoughts ( of the moment ) . so , it could be assumed that i type not really caring who is or who is not reading this . but that strange part is , after i find out people are reading it ( like the itariajin , - yoroshiku - and other friends of mine ) , i will probably post more often just because i am entertained by the idea of an audience . i am not sure if that actually is ironic , but it seemed ironic a few moments ago .  wow , the more i talk to people i have n't seen in a long time , the more i 'm glad to be back and around them . wow , the more i talk to people i have n't seen in a long time , the less i 'm glad to be back and around them . people have changed , though they may not have noticed , it 's the abscence that highlights the differences in now and last june . i never saw a gradual process , just the 'before ' and 'after ' . and then there are the people who have stayed the same . and then there are the people who just make me laugh and smile so much that i ca n't imagine how i did n't cry myself to sleep every night in japan .  that 's what she said , but in english `` a bird pooed on me [ my head ] '' . some people just make me laugh ... charity ... these are the reasons it 's great to be back . not to mention seeing a strange `` lion '' today . why do all `` lions '' have manes ? that seems to be a cross-continental pattern . long beach . utsunomiya . ajax . everywhere . and , charity was ever so helpful in brainstorming how i could graduate from high school , either this year or next . a ) get japanese credits transferred , take eng 12 during summer school . commence . b ) get japanese credits transferred , take one semester of next year . work . c ) get japanese credits transferred , take one semester of next year . enter unversity during the winter semester . d ) get japanese credits transferred , take eng 12 during summer school . commence . do the rest of grade 12 next year . i think i 'll do some stirring and get japanese credits transferred , perhaps take english in summer school , and then do at least one full semester of grade 12 and then the second semester as half days only , so i can work in the afternoons ( the root of that being that university equals dollars ) . we 'll see what guidance has to say about any of this . tomorrow .  which was amazing , to be back within my `` god family '' , seeing people that i know are sincere about growing closer to god and encouraging me to do so , but ... there 's always a but . everything seemed exactly the same . the social cliques , the stares at 'strange ' worship . while the church is a place to worship god freely and meet with other christians , whose purpose it is to do god 's will , there is still so much humanity that it will always have faults , which is what separates us from god . however , i would really appreciate it if some of these people would grow up and see how petty their differences are . and then -- > take out the log from your own eye before trying to remove the speck of dirt from someone else 's i will never stop growing . ( 2 )  `` ... do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires . '' i 'm so tired of seeing people `` go out '' , `` dump '' , `` see each other '' , `` break up '' ... '' waste '' -ing time , perhaps .  almost best friends , but the farthest possibility . itsumo waratta . itsumo . and now , we never laugh because we ca n't . i wish time was n't , but since it is , i deal with what it brings . what is the most taisetsu ? nani ga ichiban important ? kangae ni , i know it does n't matter , time will cause me to forget , or at least disattach myself . sukoshi zutsu , mainichi mo chotto . the more experience , the more complicated . but i 'd rather have something to think about than nothing to know . mada warau yo , i am still laughing ; we 'll meet again .  kyou wa watashi no sanban me nichi , nihon kara kaeta no ato . kimochi wa ? maamaa . kokoro no naka ni wa nani mo nai . mada . riam kun , kore o wakaru ? i 've always been partial to things balanced in thirds . flesh , spirit , soul .  to make a long story short , concise and to-the-point : i will be away from saturday , july 24th to an undecided date at the end of the summer . maybe i 'll come back for a week in august , still undecided . i am going to camp miniyowe ! to be a camp counsellor for my 3rd year running . i am so excited , and i get to drive the van up ( it 's kinda `` my car '' ) . so that 's that , and i hope to see some people at the end of the summer and if not ... till commencement , and best of luck in university ! or wherever the next chapter goes . ps -- > i turn 18 on august 17th ! think of me on that most delightful of days ! pps -- > if you 'd like you can send me a letter/note/postcard/card/anything in the mail to where i 'll be ( i 'd smile ) this is the address : jenny nasmith ( tuxedo ) girls ' camp camp mini-yo-we 1878 muskoka road # 10 west - rr # 2 port sydney , ontario , canada p0b 1l0 \""

       " 'found a interesting site that hosts a huge  geek test  200 questions long at least i got 3629191   major geek  d if you want to check it out your self and take the huge test go right ahead at urllink this link    my dad and i have been trying to create a water cooling system for my system  see my system is special  no really it is   it is different in it special intel cpu and motherboard specially from intel  there old hardware betas that were tossed or given to those special few  hehe   most of these betas do nt work but the ones on got here do but with some bugs  now what makes this special is that the cpu can be overclocked and normal intel cpu s ca nt in fear of reselling issues  this means that even if you have a 1 gig p4ee cpu  if they exists  the cpu can go up to 40 because the cpu architecture surpports it  now since water cooling is heck of a lot better at sucking the heat off of the cpu than air every body wants to use it because cpu s as we know it are becoming so hot that water cooling is the savior of the next 10 years of cpu s  5 gig and up  the only thing in the back of every bodies mind is that if there s a leak  so what me and my dad are going to do is take 2 water blocks  32oz water bottle  a pump  peltair cooler  a heatsink and fan  some plastic flexible piping  some sort of massive power supply  now what a peltair cooler is a passive  no moving parts  cooling system that literally sucks the heat from one side to the other side using electicity now what s funny is that we have a big one  its 50x50mm a little smaller than your palm i guess  but it sucks more power required from a car battery o_o but then again today s computer power supplies put out more than needed power for this unfortunately mine does nt the peltair cooler requires 12 volts 17 amps and 170 watts of electicty unfortunately my power supply only puts out 13 amps and 180 watts just short but if it was right i would still have to get another power supply for my computer because my computer uses some of that  i m not all sure how much  now all of this is going to put inside of a box so it nice and neat but it kinda makes a problem for one size may be a problem as i want to fit this into a small of a box as possible and my dad want to put a fan on top of the heat exchange system  waterblock  peltair  heatsink  while i want to cut a hole above the exchanger and take a 120 mm fan to it and leave the heat sink  because 120mm fans are silent and move more air besides we already have 2  double fans could be placed in as well  my other reason for this idea is that the power supply will be creating a great about of heat as well  if this is to  fuzzy  for you to really get an idea what i trying to say just comment your questions and i will try to answer them because this is just plan after all with some pieces  oh and my sister ordered and received a linkin park sweater in the start of summer just because she was so crazy to get it  i still do nt understand why she listens to people who yell until there lungs are dangling out  well that s all for today  ',\n",

       " 'what is bipolar disorder  most of you who are visiting this site probably have a good idea what it is like to be bipolar or love someone who is  for those of you who just happened along by chance let me tell you about a mental disorder that is far more prevalent than you could ever imagine  bipolar disorder also known as manic depression affects over 2million adults in the united states  what is more startling is that up to 34 million children and adolescents in the united states have this disorder  there is a good chance that you know several people who suffer with bipolar disorder and you have never noticed  that s because once treated with the proper medication these people can go on to lead a normal life that is relatively free of symptoms  the important part is being diagnosed and receiving the correct medication  which can be the most difficult part  bipolar disorder is not simply depression  nor is it simply the extreme  energetic highs  but a combination of the two  in children it often presents differently and for that reason is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed  children can begin showing signs of the disorder as early as age two  some common signs to watch out for are  irritable and dysphoric mood  mood shifts throughout the day  nightmares and night terrors  excessive worryanxiety grandiose thinking  believing they can do anything  even fly  heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli  tags in clothes  feel of fabric  sock nubbies  physical aggression  often without provocation  excessively talkative  pressured speach periods of increased energy  often accompanied by insomnia lower frustration tolerance and impatience deliberate destruction of property  you may be saying to yourself  my child has several of these symptoms but our doctor said heshe was adhd  91  of bipolar children under the age of 12 will meet the criteria for adhd and they could have adhd at the same time  this is what is called a comorbid diagnosis  the difference with bipolar disorder is it is episodic in nature  your child could be fine one minute and the next fly into a rage over the brand of orange juice you bought  diagnoses and treatment are extremely important in children  episodes tend to worsen in children without proper treatment  school can become a nightmare and suicide is a real possibility  when bipolar disorder is undiagnosed and treated as adhd only the medication can cause a child to enter a manic state  i ca nt stress the importance of finding someone who will properly diagnose your child and put them on the proper medication  the national dbsa website can help you find a qualified physician in your area  ',\n",

       " 'she was too young to die  but during her short life she touched so many people  mallory was a ray of sunshine on a stormy day  hundreds of people filled the church to overflowing to say goodbye to a girl who was taken from this world far too soon  many of these mourners were teenagers and some were younger  as mallory had left behind a younger sister  and an older sister and brother  how do so many teenagers understand something like death  when you are a teenager you believe you are invincible  that nothing can touch you  it is devastating to discover that this is not true  when a teen loses a loved one they suffer intensely  as adults we often disregard their intense feelings because we are dealing with the loss ourselves or we think they will recover sooner since they are young and resilient  we have taught them to suppress their anger  they know it is okay to feel sadness  but anger will not benefit anyone  this is not true  they need to express their anger  they have been abandoned by someone they love  that is painful  it is not fair and it makes them angry  it is one of the most natural responses to the loss they are feeling  we need to reassure them  that as adults we are there for them  we will not judge their anger or their fear  the fear of being left behind or the fear of also being taken before their time  grief is a very unique to each of us  but for adolescents it is complex  often beyond their realm of understanding  they may push us away when we try to help them and thinking that solitude is what they need we will let them  we often have the misconception that because they look like adults now  that they think like adults  they may exhibit stages of shock and disbelief  if they do nt think about it maybe it wo nt hurt so much  they can function as if life is going on as usual when they are actually feeling numb and as yet unaware of the pain  this stage often lasts for the first few weeks after the event  they often cry  ache  do nt sleep  have a difficult time making decisions  may yell and fight with family and friends and may fluctuate between denial and anger  during the next stage of the grieving process the numbness has ended and the guilt  depression  hopelessness  anger  and increased sensitivity occur  this could begin a few weeks after the death and continue for months  guilt is a natural process  all adolescents have disagreements with friends and family  but when a death occurs the teen will take guilt and responsibility for the tragedy   if only i had told her i loved her more    if only i had driven instead of him   these are normal feelings for everyone  but are often more intense for teens  thoughts of suicide are also common during this stage  as parents we have to be willing to listen without judgment or panic  we hear that our child does nt want to live and we panic  get angry or frightened and often do nt let them express their feelings  when what we really need to do is listen  you ca nt fix this pain for them and they are entitled to it  it is normal to think of escaping the pain or joining the person they loved  often when you share that you have felt this way too and it is all part of the grief process it is reassuring to them  do be aware of the true signs of suicide  if they have a plan on how they would end their own life  seek professional help immediately  this is not a time to wait and see if they feel better in a day or two  call a suicide hotline or go directly to your nearest emergency room  it is better to be safe than sorry  during the next few months  36 months after the death  you may find your teen trying to pretend as if nothing happened  they may tell you they do nt want to talk about it anymore  they may gain or loss weight and try to change their location or lifestyle in order to get out of the surroundings that remind them so much of what they wish had never occured  it is a temporary solution to a permanet problem  this is the stage where a true depression can set in and they begin to feel like they will never stop grieving  know the signs and seek help if you feel medication may be needed temporarily  to admit you need help is not a sign of weakness  but of strength  time does heal all wounds or at least lessen them so we can tolerate them  it could take up to two years  for some  more and others less  a good support network can help shorten the process for some and professional counseling for others  you will see your teen emerge again from the grief and sorrow that has been a constant companion for so long  they could feel hopeful and optimistic  ready to move on  but never forget  there will still be times when the grief will resurface  birthdays  anniversary s of the death  and joyous occasions that their loved one ca nt share and will never experience  it will be cleansing for all of you to talk about your feelings openly and honestly  it is good to cry together and laugh together while sharing memories  as i said earlier  grief is different for everyone  we must help each other through it and hopefully we will all emerge on the other side closer and more bonded than ever  do nt let your teen or child grieve alone  do nt hide your grief from them and tell them they need to be strong for each other  they need to love and support each other  share and be honest with each other and hopefully move forward together hand in hand  in closing  mallory  you will never be forgotten and in time hopefully your family and friends will be able to accept and cope with their loss  even though they may never really understand it  please help guide them through this process and help them remember your beautiful spirit that was the true essence of life  ',\n",

       " 'last night at the dbsa meeting the group had a varied discussion on hospitalization  it is not something any of us want to think about for ourselves  but is even harder when we must consider it for our children  sometimes it is the only answer and a far better one than looking the other way  children i know of as young as five have attempted suicide  with teens  the numbers are skyrocketing  it is not unusual for a bipolar child or teen to be hospitalized and parents should expect this and try to be prepared  i know it is not something we really want to prepare for  but if your child had cancer you would check out the hospitals to be sure your child got the best care possible  when dealing with a mental facility this is even more important  they are not all created equally  if you have health insurance  you may not have a choice of which facility to use  be sure to call your mental health plan administrator and take notes  in a time of crisis you will probably not be able to think straight  let alone make all the calls and decisions  some of the things to ask about if you do call or visit a unit are  how many registered nurses are on a unit  there should be more than one  and more nurses than psych technicians and aids  ask about involuntary administration of medication  seclusion and restraints  these should only be used as a last resort or not at all  find out how often you will be able to see and speak to your child  often a children s unit will only let you visit on certain days and times  they often want the child to have as little contact with the parents as possible because they feel the parent is the child s main problem  this is extremely important if your child is very young or if they have separation issues  find out what happens when your child is released  is there a support group for your child and for you  do they offer parenting classes  will your child require special aftercare such as a half day program for a while  it will never be easy to put your child in a hospital even if you think it would be a real relief for a little while  the more you know and the more prepared you are the easier it will be to deal with  pack a bag to take with the child  be sure to include a stuffed animal for them to sleep with  usually with clothing they want you to send two of everything and label it all with your child s name  leave everything else at home  the hospital will check the bag and you will have to sign off on the contents  if the child is allowed any other items  like a favorite quilt or music  the staff will advise you and you can bring it when you visit  be sure before you leave you know what number to call to check on your child and who you would contact with a complaint or problem  hopefully you wo nt have any problems  but it is good to be prepared  the most important thing to remember is that you are not alone  try to find a support group for yourself  ',\n",

a curve hugging  meow   kind of dress on  some strappy heels and jumped in a cab with my equally fabulous friend  we sauntered in the place  well  you ca nt really saunter with strappy needlethin heels on  but you get the point  and did the whole classic stand at the entrance with your best  i m wayyyyyyy too cool for this  poutface on and scanned the bar for a friendly face    dan  hi

of course i am referring to my dress and it is a joke  i am trying to be funny  change the subject  get away  he looks at my dress and says   yes you look ravishing    thanks   i say  unsure as to whether he is making fun of me or not  i decide that he is nt  he s just being a dirty old man  the introductions are being done slowly  each of these men has his own special way of leering  i prepare myself for quite a night  finally michelle and i get the chance to order some wine  we take sips from our glasses and are quiet alone for a moment   am i doing okay   i ask from the corner of my mouth   yes     do i look okay    yes    do i really look like a lesbian    yes   i love michelle   okay so we start filtering into the dining room where a long  thin table has been set up for us  we are a group of about 14 or 16  who knows  one of the dirty old men holds my waist and tells me that the seating arrangements will have to be girl  guy  girl  guy  which is hilarious because michelle and i are the only two women there  but anyway this particular dirty old man  we ll call him yellow shirt  sits between us  but a gentleman at first  holding out our chairs and seating us  which was nice  not enough guys do that   i am clinging to my wine  all around me are men in pastel shirts  except for one  he is sitting directly in front me me  has bushy eyebrows  thick hairy arms and is obviously the man in charge here  he has a black shirt  he is the president of the affiliate company  he looks like a pouter  i know to be nice  a pouter  by the way  is a man who absolutely needs to get his own way  get the last word  be the funniest or he will punch hole in a wall  it would be cute if it were nt so scary  pouters are the worst losers  if a pouter gets the wrong order in a restaurant  he s the one that wo nt say anything but who will kind of sigh and move food around on his plate rather than eat  he wants everyone to know how much his food sucks  if you turn down a pouter s advances in front of his friends  he will call you a lesbian  and then go out and buy a corvette  anyway pouters are scary   i m not sure how it happened but somehow the conversation went from me explaining what i do for a living to me explaining why i do nt wear underwear  facts about underwear  1  they serve no purpose for me  i have nothing to pin down hold up or hold in  underwear are useless  2  granny bums  what i call panties  are bulky and can be seen through whatever it is that you are wearing  there is nothing classy about underwear lines  i do nt care who you are  3  thongs are uncomfortable  an inch of lacy fabric in the crack of my ass for 12 hours a day  no thanks  4  i have no one to impress  if i had a man who liked underwear and liked to see me in them  i would wear them  i own a few pairs  i even own a garter belt  another one of those devices with no purpose  but as it stands  with my life the way it is now  it is much simpler just to go commando  faqs no  i do not wear underwear even when wearing a short skirt  no  my skirt has never flown up and exposed my bare ass  no  i would not be embarassed if it did  no  i do not wear underwear when i work out  yes  i get weird looks in the changing room   from there things went from bad to worse  do nt forget  we ve all been drinking wine  and the dinner was about 2 hours long  after two hours of drinking good french wine and eating good fifty dollar steaks  things are bound get to a little casual  these guys are asking me questions that i have no idea how to answer  like if i like to receive oral sex  what kind of qiestion is that    i am the same age as some of their daughters i m sure  a fact i wanted to point out  but i held my tongue  not my place  just grin and bear it  thankfully i got a little peice of redemption by the end of the night when the pouter was paying the bill and the maitre d came to tell him that he had a phone call  ha ha ha we all know what that means fucker  you should pay your visa bill on time  obviously my cue to leave   michelle and i shared a cab with her colleague lou and yellow shirt and ended up at this godawful bar called winnie s on crescent street  we were waiting for the rest of the dirty old men to show up  winnie s was playing poser rock from the early nineties  which was giving yellow shirt a hard on  he wanted to dance  he kept asking me to go up to the floor with him  by the 4th time turning him down i felt sort of bad and allowed myself to be pulled up to the makeshift dancefloor  i looked way too fabulous to be dancing with some old man at winnies of all fucking places  then michelle s boss showed up  this old puritan by day and sadomasochist by night type guy who smells like old money and looks british  at one point lou fucked off  leaving michelle and i with boss and yellow shirt  dancing to early nineties cheeze rock   michelle  you know everyone here thinks we re escorts   i said when we sat back down  we looked around and knew i was right  i mean think about it  two hot 24 year old girls dressed to the gills with these two fucking geisers wearing pastel shirts and shaking their little asses to springteen  my god what happened to us  it was clearly time to go  we took the metro home  hugged at my front door and as i walked up the stairs into my normal life with my kitten and my book and my tv  i thought  thank god i have a life to go back to  ',\n",

       " 'they call wednesday hump day  but i can tell you ladies and gentlemen that it has been my experience that maybe 36 out of 52 times a year  this is false   wednesday is the second worst day of the week  contrary to popular beleif  tuesday is the worst  beating monday by a long shot  here is why  monday  you are fresh from the weekend and although you did nt sleep as much as you would any other day  you just slept in for like 2 days straight so it is nt that big of a deal  you know in the back of your mind that you will be sitting in an office for the next 40 hours of your life  and you are okay with that  because you are relaxed  you most certainly got drunk over the weekend  you might have gotten laid but you at least probably masterbated like 4 times  you re feeling pretty good  tuesday is the worst because you are more tired  and you still have 32 hours of work left in your week  minimum  but now you are less relaxed and the thought of spending the majority of your life in an office is nt as tolerable as it was the day before  it s like the rest of your week is waving at you from a beach and going na na na na na na it s only tuesday  sucker  then wednesday is a little bit better but not much because you ca nt say until like 100 in the afternoon that the week is half over  and then there s the whole issue of calling it hump day which  as i said  is sadly often not the case  thursday kicks ass as the 2nd best day of the week  for a lot of us  thursday is pay day so that s cool  also it is a pretty good day to party  you re not too tired yet from the week  and there is only one day to go until the weekend  friday is overrated  it s cool because if your office is nice and is likely to give you short days at work  chances are these days will fall on a friday  but fridays are always stressful at the office because of deadlines and preparing for the weekend  and then you re too tired to party friday night  unless you take a nap  but friday evening naps are the worst  they make you feel worse than had you not slept at all  unless you are one of those people who can take 4 hour power naps and climb mountains or something  of course you can always take drugs  but do nt  it s bad for you  anyway fridays are the 3rd best day in the week  saturday is the best day of the week because from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed  everything you do is completely up to you  there are no deadlines  no reasons to be awake  no reasons to do anything  you can sit on your couch naked for 3 hours eating ice cream and picking lint out of your belly button if you want to  and then that night  you get dressed up  throw some heels on and party like your life depends on it and it s like you re alive  really alive  for the first time in 7 days  okay maybe i am exaggerating a bit but you have to admit  saturday is pretty kick ass from start to finish  sunday is the middle day  because you can wake up at whatever time you want and there are no deadlines  but it sucks a little too because sunday is usually laundrycleaninggrocery shopping etc day  also sunday is the day of hangovers  physical and emotional  if you did nt do anything that weekend this is the day to feel like a big fat loser and question your existence  then again  if you did too much and woke up in some strange man s bedroom with mascara all over your face and wondering what his name was  this is the day to feel bad about that too   so to recap  the days of the week  in order from best to worst are  1saturday 2thursday 3friday 4sunday 5monday 6wednesday 7tuesday ',\n",

       " 'i went to a house party this weekend in the old port  it was the first house party i had been to in a really really long time  house parties just are nt worth throwing anymore i guess  which is too bad  because i always enjoy them  anyway this particular house party had an eighties theme  which was about 2 minutes away from getting old but thankfully the hosts got the idea in time   michelle  sonia and i decided to go to village des valeurs to get some cheapo radical stuff to wear because we take theme parties and halloween very seriously  also we did nt want to spend too much money on stuff we were nt likely to ever wear again  eighties is really in style now and honestly it s not something i m thrilled about  my eyes are always gagging  it hurts  because people  honestly  if acid washed jeans were nt cool the first time around  i doubt that making them 200 dollars more expensive will help them to be cooler  also i am pretty poor these days  the reason for this is when i have money i have no sense of self control  i spend spend spend  logic being if i die tomorrow i would rather have stuff than money in the bank   okay so we went to le chateau first because as i mentioned before  80 s is really in now and personally speaking i would rather spend 20 bucks on something half decent that can be worn again maybe twice than spend 5 bucks on something so ugly i have to burn it when i m done  but there was nothing there worth buying  the only thing they had were those godawful dust ruffle skirts that i hate more than anything else in fashion right now  and those striped tops that look like they should be worn with berets and 100 mm cigarettes  sonia and i used to work at village des valeurs back in our punk rock days so we know how to shop there  it was the coolest job  we were essentially paid to shop becuase every article of clothing we saw and liked  we put in the back and bought at lunch  also it was a cool job because when we were tired or hungover or both  we would sleep in the clothing bins in the back where they sort the clothes  sonia and i started in the dress aisle and within minutes were on the floor holding our bellies  laughing so hard i swear to god i thought i was going to pee  these dresses were from the 80 s alright  gold lamée  ruffles  bows  sequins  tassles  they were like little metallic crimes against humanity  my eyes were vomitting left and right  but i knew that we had stumbled upon a goldmine  because michelle heard us laughing from another section in the store and came to see what the fuss was about  you know you have something good when your friends hear you laughing in a store the size of a football field  we had found a dress that was perfect for her  and begged her to try it on  she knew looking at it that it was perfect and that it was going to fit her too  we will do anything for comedy  so she tried it on and the fucking thing fit her like a glove  if it were 1987 and she was going to her prom  this might be what she would have bought  it fit her that well  shit she almost made it look good  so now that she was in  sonia and i had to find dresses that were equally atrocious  which was nt hard  within 20 minutes all three of us were standing around the changing rooms laughing hysterically and admiring how bad we looked   are we really going to do this   sonia asked  you could tell that each of us privately hoped the other would back out  there was no way in hell any of us would dress this way alone   i ll do it if you do it   was the standard response  of course we did it  like i said  anything for the sake of comedy  sonia picked up something for her boyfriend dean  and we were laughing our way back to the car   5 hours later we were at sonia s house and all dressed up and ready to go  when i figure out how to get pics up here i will show you  but for now you will have to rely on my description of what we looked like  sonia clearly looked the best by today s stanbdards  actually she looked almost like madonna in the like a virgin video  her dress was shell pink and had two layers  first was the silky layer and on top was this layer of lace  it buttoned up to her neck and had long sleeves with puffy shoulders  it was hideous  she bought a satin pink clutch purse to go with it  and tied her hair in a side ponytail that she teased the shit out of  unfortunately she did nt get any shoes so she wore her red globes  which sort of gave her away  michelle michelle looked the most authentic  her dress had long sleeves  with a black velour bodice  and magenta satin ruffle skirt complete with large bow in the front and white beaded tassles strategically placed at the seams  her shoulders were 5 inches high with puffiness  she teased the shit of her hair and got this enormous cowlick too  it was at least 4 inches high  she got this godawful purple purse to go with it  again  she did nt bother buying any shoes for the occassion so was wearing these brown bowling style shoes  which gave her away  me i looked the worst  when we went to buy beer at the depanneur near sonia s place  these people who were attending another party kind of laughed at us for a bit  one of them thought i was in drag at first  yep  when a guy thinks you re in drag  you know you are not sexy  my dress was the most hideous of them all  a metallic blue  shin length long sleeved nightmare  it had a two inch wedge of foam in each shoulder  which created the illusion that i could play for the montreal allouettes  the dress had two really bad qualities  one  the triangle of missing material in the back so that my back was exposed  and not in a good way  and two  the fact that it was aline from tits to hips so it kind of made me look like a door wearing a skirt  seriously  everything that i hate about my body was highlighted by wearing this dress  and everything i like about my body was either hidden or overshadowed   given that i am single  this story has 2 points  1  that i am very very brave  and 2  i was not getting laid that night   along with my dress i wore these really tacky  fake gold  sea shell shaped earrings  and carried this black and fakegold clutch purse  again  no shoes  so had to wear my red roxys  my hair was in a high  side ponytail with really big bangs and i even gave myself a fake mole a la madonna  in other words  i am a complete loser with no sense of dignity   i really should have predicted this  it s so fitting  but no one else at the party dressed up except for this one guy who wore a dangly earing and aviator glasses a la george michael  and this chick who wore a banana yellow outfit complete with patent leather yellow pumps  so michelle  sonia and i stuck out like three really big shouldered freaks  but we did manage to make it look cool  and that s what really matters  in fact  those people we met at the dep near sonia s house ended up coming to the party because they thought  hey  if these chicks are dressed like that  it has to be cool  and it was  ',\n",

the scene  an elderly couple s living room  you can tell by the serious lack of vibrant color and the doillies everywhere  i think the main color is beige  and the couch  it s brown and just reeks of a visit to your grandmother  you could almost smell the mothballs  there is an old phonograph playing some crooner style music  think honeymooners theme song  which is hilarious because our grandparents all still love their phonographs  yeah  in this archaic museum of sadness and tragedy we call their living room  we find grandma and grandpa  they re old  they have poochie little bellies and are wearing varying shades of grey and beige  also they are both wearing cardigans  the uniform of the elderly right  in classic marketing attention to detail  one is sitting in a settee and the other in an arm chair because old people who have been married for more than 3 or 4 years intrinsically hate each other and do not want to sit too close  which is why there is a collective aw  from society when we see old people holding hands and still loving each other but that s another rant altogether  visiting them is a dashing young 15 or 16 year old kid  you can tell he s dashing by the sporty ensemble in bright colors he is wearing on his perfectly sporty  wholesome looking body  i m telling you  attention to detail folks  he s sitting on a couch  facing grandpa and grandma  there is a tenseness between them that indicates that they are not related  because of they were  it would be weird  actually  it would be knee deep in kerouac s mother s territory   so someone  i m guessing the kid  pours a bag of skittles  and the colors pop like gumballs in a sea of grey ladies and gentleman  you got ta love marketing  into a fucking candy dish  because if old people love anything  it s candy dishes  and the next thing you see is one very old  very arthritic hand reach into the bowl and grab a bunch with an audible  hm  that says  hm  bright little dots of candy  interesting  maybe these will make me forget that i am an 85 year old marketing tool   next thing you know there s grandpa scratching with the record on the phonograph  i m no expert here but i doubt you could get a decent sound from scratching a record on a phonograph  anyway  and grandma stands up to do a rap about how she s a badass  and the kids of north america are screaming with glee because look how cool  grandma s rapping  but then bad gets worse  at the end of her little rap  grandma grabs her blouse and cardigan in each arthritic hand and rips that fucker wide open for the kid to see  okay  i m guessing  praying   that grandma is wearing a bra but still  dude s face when she unleashes her girls is one of shock  disgust and fear  he gets up like a 15 year old boyscout and puts one of those couch doillies on her  to cover her up  and sits her down back into the arm chair like an accident victim  meanwhile  in happy colors that make your retinas beg for mercy  skittles is telling you to taste the rainbow  hey skittles  why do nt you taste my ass you fucking arseholes   understatement   i have a few problems with this ad  for one  i think that we as a society should have more respect for our elderly than that  in a world where there are literally six million ways to die  i respect the shit out of people who manage to make it 80 years without kicking the bucket  these geysers obviously have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel  giving death the big fuck you  the least we can do is not make them flash their grandkids during a visit  seriously  and if i see one more grandma rapping i swear to god i will unleash a fury unparalleled  and believe me boys  i can do it   another problem i have is that the woman s hands are fucking gnarled with arthritis  her fingers are practically curved for crying out loud  it must have hurt her  physically hurt this poor woman s hands  to do this commercial  the next time you see this ad  look at her hands and think about all the takes she would have had to do to get the fucking scene right  i want to vomit with rage just thinking about it  i hate it so much i would boycott skittles if i thought they were good enough to be worth boycotting  as it stands i associate skittles with carsickness and have nt had any in at least 10 years  colorful bite sized shit pellets as far as i m concerned   some of my friends think the commercial is hilarious and claim to have almost peed when they saw it the first time  i guess that s what skittles was going for  these friends  the proflashers  think i should grow a sense of humour about it  people really  if anyone on this planet has a sense of humour it s me  i just do nt think that old ladies should be used as marketing tools  in fact  i resent that before this commercial made it to air  before the shoot even  a group of people in business suits sat around a big black table and actually had a conversation about how great it would be to have an old woman flashing some teenager for a commercial  and that the majority of them thought it was a good idea  that s what i resent the most  that these suit wearing  toyota corolla driving  palm pilot using  adultering  fishing on the weekends and playing golf in the morning fuckers had the nerve to discuss this commercial idea  have a good laugh  pat themselves on the fucking back and say yep  this ones a keeper  ',\n",

yesterday to cut myself and have it off  though i did scrape a little  the elastic band is just not the same  one of the bad things about all of this is my inability to  feel  much of anything

this the medication or the depression  1  i sleep alot at home  2  i was able to handle a situation with three students  when i started to get upset i took a breath and spoke firmly but calmly to them

will probably sound selfish  foolish  and just plain crazy to anyone who has never had a mental illness  but for some it will probably sound all too familiar  it has been over 4 years since i was hospitalized and in many ways my life is better  the night before being admitted i spent an hour or so at church  asking god to help me  i had everything planned for the following tuesday  i was supposed to go to a house party  tupperware  something   by the time anyone realized i was nt at home or at the party  i would be dead  now i look back and think that god did answer my prayers and put me in the hospital  but sometimes it gets to be too much and right now is one of those times  i am hoping that reading and transcribing this will help me now  monday  march 6  2000 thursday night seemed surreal  waiting for hous in my work clothes  saying goodbyes to garrett and peter at their office and going to my appointment  dr p was nice but i was upset with his almost immediate suggestion that i go to nhe even took my keys away  then there was the wait to get there  it was very difficult to sign the papers admitting myself  then questions  questions and more questions  each time a new person  a new set of questions  everything i owned was searched  finally i got a bedonly to have another patient go out of control and spend the next 4 or so hours screaming  eventually i slept a little  friday morning brought more of the same  breakfast  tests  questions and then group meetings  all i wanted to do was sleep  i did nt want to participate in anything  my medication was changed  by friday afternoon i began to feel more a part of the hospital  which in a way is scary because part of me does nt believe i belong here  however there have benn many moments when i feel the anger and agitation and both yesterday and today cut myself  i feel like i m being sucked into a whirlpool and i just want to hit bottom so i can start climbing out  everything revolves around that magic daythe day of discharge  lots of jokes  tears  and arguments involved  medication seems to be another important aspect of the day  no one yet has refused meds and i assume that they  like me  hope to get some or any relief from the magic pills  normally i do not take medication  but here i make sure i am one of the first to mine and that they are working well  anything that will stop my racing mind  lesson the ever present thoughts of cutting myself or slitting my wrists and watching the blood drain away  even at night i have accepted sleeping pills which will put me int a deep quick sleep and leave me from my own thoughts  i really want the whirlpool to stop  tuesday  march 7  2000 each time i think i have hit bottomi find one more way to sink lower  yesterday i was so desparate to cut my wristbut i did tell the doctor  they gave me an extra atavan which helped a bit but i still ended up cutting myself while under observation  they took my paperclip away and gave me a rubberband to snap  it was nt much of a substitute  in the afternoon the doctor changed my medication again and gave me something called resparin  sp    i was pretty tired last night but today i have felt pretty good  i have nt felt a strong urge to cut myself and just now for the first time actual felt like looking forward to planting flowers  it was the first time in months that i have nt felt dead inside  the doctor talked about me going home which kind of scares me because while i feel good now i worry that i may not be ready and since i know i have no problem cutting myself i m afraid i would slit my wrists if i felt bad again  well could nt make it through the afternoon without extra medication  i spoke to the counselor about writing an  obituary  for the child i ca nt seem to have the thoughts of dealing with the painful emotions has made me very anxious  i will try to write this later  in group earlier today i shared the fact i feel more comfortable here  i do nt have to go around hiding my feelings and acting like everything is ok other people here actually understand how i feel  they know the cutting relieves the anger and how the deadness hurts  they understand that no matter how many people care about you  when you are feeling worst you ca nt comprehend that and it has no effect  in second group today we discussed being assertive  i think i am probably much too passive most of the time and then change it to aggression at home  i need to learn to be honest about my feelings and stand up for my rights and needs while respecting others  others  the group counselors  said this would probably be uncomfortable but i am going to try  wednesday  march 8  2000 last night was a terrible night  i had trouble sleeping and when i asked to have a snack i was denied and treated like a child  i was already upset and had all sorts of things running through my head and my anxiety level just grew until i was so angry  i ended up cutting myself again  first thing this morning i spoke to the dr  i toldhim a lot of things i did nt realized were bothering me  i need to learn to deal with my anger and frustration better  i think i probably also need to make sure i have more time for myself  i want to work really hard to try and be out of here by monday  even though i still feel badi really do need to get to be with my family  i did write about sophieit was very emotional and caused a lot of anxiety but i think if felt alot better  i will try reading it again later to see how i feel about what i wrote  sophie sophie annette s you were born with lots of dark hair and those newborn blue eyes  you were small and thin but healthy  just like your brother  even though g protested  he loved you and helping with you  as you grew your hair turned lighter and your eyes changed to match your dad s eyes  you smiled often and enjoyed being with people  the stubborn streak that seems to be a family trait was quite apparent  you loved getting dirty and being outside and as you began to crawl and walk you alway s managed to get into g s stuff  you grew quickly and continued to annoy your brother  though through all the fights and arguing it was apparent that you loved one another  your freckled face and short dark hair combined with your lovely green eyes created a unique and beautiful little girl  you grew to be questioning and independent  sometimes to the point of trouble  you experienced many of the trials and tribulations of being a teenager but survived these all right to be a confident  selfassured  happy adult  sophie  though i never met you  i have held you in my arms a thousand times  i know what you smell like  what your face looks like when your nursing and how warm and soft your fingers are on my hand  i know what it looks like when g helps you learn to walk and you often play and wrestle and even fight together  i can see running outside in the summer barefooted in a a little green dress and watch you pick dandelions for me  i have seen your daddy holding you and playing with you and watching you proudly  i have watched you grow from a spindly legged little girl into a graceful attractive women  sophiethough i will probably never meet you i will always love you with all my heart   since that time i have seen in a dream a toddler sophie wave goodbye and take the hand of some unknown relative

       " 'so far this summer one of the biggest things i ve noticed is the difference between guys and girls  the first difference between guys and girls is time  guys just seem to be able to get ready and go places in way way way less time then it takes girls  if a guy has to he can be woken up and out of the house in about five minutes  whereas girls seem to need at least an hour before there ready to go  what they do in this hour of time remains a mystery to me  i think it could have something to do with masturbation  just joshing  anyways  some girls can get ready really quickly and even the slower girls have been quick sometimes  guys are also much more effiecient shoppers then girls  which is weird because guys never go shopping and pretty much without exception we hate shopping  when i ve been shopping with girls they do nt really seem to have any idea what they want to get and just go to look at stuff  wheres the fun in that    but as one of my good friends put it   all the fun in shopping is going to different stores and trying stuff on   to each his own i guess  cause shopping is nt fun  although the last time i went i actually enjoyed it  but thats probably because things were running smoothly and i knew what i was looking for  anyways  i think that girls should just hire guys to shop for them  that way they d save time they could be using to get ready  just joshing  another difference between guys and girls is the  big deal  and  complicated  stuff  most people think us guys are simple creatures  which for the most part is true  however  us guys can be very complicated when we want to be and when it concerns certain issues  for example  lets say a guy wanted someone to come over  but they did nt want that person to come over unless they wanted to  that said guy would ask the girl if she wanted to come over but act like he did nt really care what happened  pretty confusing stuff eh  for the most part everytime a guy tries to be complicated and tricky his plan backfires and he ends up feeling stupid  but for the most part guys are pretty simple  we say what we mean  most of the time  and usually do nt sugar coat anything  just look at bc   girls on the other hand  tend to make things complicated when they do nt have to be  they over anaylze things  try and get meaning out of meanless stuff  hold grudges agaisnt people who are trying to set things right  say they do nt care about something that bothers them  or do nt do what they want to do  now for the big deal stuff  for the most part guys make big deals out of relationship issues and really important stuff could actually effect people  the rest of the stuff we do nt really care to much about and usually just drop things or give in during arguments or discussions  we do nt really think your right when we do this  but we just do this because we know its no biggie   girls  on the other hand  can make big deals out of anything  and when they try and argue they do nt tend to make any sense  at least to me   for example  i ll give a scenerio  say there is a hot spoon on the table  they would pick up the spoon knowing its hot and then when they got burned they d get mad at the person for leaving the spoon out  just don  t pick up the spoon ydb  that little story did nt really make a lot of sense  but theres actually some weird deeper meaning and parrallels to real life events hidden in the story  anyways  this little comparison kinda turned into a little rant so i ve kinda got ta cover my ass and say some truthful stuff that wo nt offend anyone  there are no girls i know that always make things complicated or do anything of the stuff i just said all the time  and there are some guys who take there sweet time and make things complicated when they are nt  i should know because i make things complicated sometimes   so there are big exceptions to the whole comparison thing  but for the most part i think its sort of accurate  everyone do a comparison of there own and tell me what they think the differences between guys and girls are  thanks  cheers  mick ',\n",
       " 'well  today is the 11th of august and summer is half over  back to school ads are popping up everywhere and the days are even getting shorters  its dark out by  930   so you d think with my favorite time of the whole year coming to an end i may be bummed out  well  not this year  so far my summers been great and i ve done lots of fun stuff  like learning to ride the bus  just joshing  that was nt really fun   i ve also got a feeling that the rest of the summer is gon na be awesome as well  unfortunetly i m going away at the end of august cause i really wish i could spend the rest of summer with my friends and girlfriend  but hey  the ok is a fun place and i m sure it ll be great  the driving lessons suck big time though  there super boring and we are pretty much just going through a book and watching really really lame videos  pretty crappy eh  but those lessons are only six hours outta the whole week  also i m subbing down at the pool so it looks like the next six days are gon na be pretty busy  which does nt really bother me cause the moneys great and i love being busy  although a relaxing night or day every now and then is great as well  as long as its fun   a lot of people are coming and going these days and its kinda been hard to keep in touch with all the people i would have liked to keep in touch  i m not too worried about this because i ve seen lots of my best buddies all summer  just got ta get some more alone time with my girl and then lifes pretty much perfect for me  yeah  this has been a great summer so far and the next half of it should be just as great  hope everyones summers been great  cheers  mick ',\n",
       " 'i do nt really have anything to write about tonight so i m just going to fill you in with whats on my mind these days  well  for starters last night was pretty fun  got stoned and watched riverdance with micheal flattley  some crazy stuff  i also got to see a bunch of older people i used to play baseball with and hang out with way back in the day so that good  anyways  what else happened that night  i won some money playing cards and my girl got mad at me cause she thought i was making fun of her  which i guess i kinda was  if you read this i m sorry   but yeah  its all good  funny stuff  one of my good buddies is back from mexico so i got to see her today which was great and yeah  things are good right now  went shopping with my bud today for birthday stuff  which went pretty well actually  i think guys are much better shoppers than girls  cause were more effiecient and we always come out with what we wanted to get  so yeah  that was kinda weird spending the afternoon shopping but yeah  it was actually kinda fun today  cheers  mick ',\n",
       " 'well  now that i ve actually been stoned i have to say that weed is pretty good  i love the feeling of being drunk because you get both a physical and mental effect  whereas i think weed is just mental  because when you focus really hard you can do things normally  except tie a tie  tonight would be the second time i have actually been stoned and it was really fun  we hit out of a bong  which was a first for me and we even had ice cubes and all that in the bong  weed is cheaper than beer but i think i may like being drunk better just because i cough with feed and my breathe gets pretty bad  you do feel really comfortable when your stoned though  its like your sitting by an open fire  the warmth tingling feeling all over your body  its a good feeling  then your body feels really heavy and you sink into the couch  anyways  we watched riverdance with michael flattley and it was pretty good  its been fun  cheers  mick ',\n",

just do what i do nt  get a life  so well  anyway  erhm  i got myself a blog  but i dunno anything funny to actually post on it  lem me just post a few thing in my life that are not so incredible funny  me family  i got one little brother of 8 years old  and a little sis of 12  and sometimes  most of the time  i hate them very much  there only goal in live seems to be to annoy me  and make my life as miserable as possible my mom decided after 17 years of happily marriage that she doesnt like my dad  she gets a divorce  and then turns lesbian and runs off with her best friend yay  well  the only normal person in my family is my dad  he s the kinda guy that doesnt punish ya for every little thing  and he tries to understand people and stuff  and he s really cool and all  but he is still one of the people i rarther not talk to about complicated stuff in my life  me friends  woah  i dont really got much friends  actually  i just have one good friend  and the others are just a bunch of loser hanging around us  vince is my best friend  he s just a weird dude  like me  we have the same interests  we act the same  and we both dont give shit about life  at least  not  school  only stupid thing with liking the same things is  also liking the same girls  offcourse then there is sander  just ya regular jerkoff wannabee computernerd  300  gay  noone likes him really  but he hangs around us  and pretend we follow him instead of he following us  so that basicly the typical guy ya rather want to ditch  but a well  and there is this that dude  polo  man  i belive in tolerance and that stuff  but fuck him  let him die and burn in hell  this guy is a real prankster  he thinks he s pretty funny  doing stuff like stealing books  trowing pencils outta the window  call you sick at school  stuff like that  he hangs around sander a lot  so he s basicly stuck to us see  i dont like the last two guys  but vince is a friend of sander  so they always just tag along with him well  those are my  friends  in a nutshell o wait  i would almost forget the few  very few nice girls in our class that say hi to us when we see them  just to me and vince    those girls are nice  they are one of the few reasons i wan na goto school me lovelife  i thought this was gon na be empty sheet for a long time  but i guess there still are a few women that dig weirdo s  a few  a very slim number  at first there where these few girls   not gon na say names  they dont like that    that liked me  but once they got to know me  that love was soon over  well  at least they showed me what women actually care about the outside  and even that suprised me  and still does  then i got this crush on a girl in the first year on junior high  at least i think its called junior high  the schools and shit are different here in holland  well  anyway  i thought i had a crush on her  but soon i realised that i didnt  i was just lonely  and then the final bomb  the drop that really did it  a girl in my class  the 3th year now  i really really like this girl  she is like the first love of my life but as i said sooner  my best friend also likes her  and so do like 10 other people  slim change for me there  so i allready dealt on big loss  and cried my eyeballs out  sorta   well  that kinda maked me not going to love a girl anymore till i m like 16 or 18  just i m just not in a mood to fall in love after this list of dissasters  my school  my school just sucks  and i mean that like major sucks  my class is filled with nerd s  and a few sluts too  no offence  you can see my grades really sticking out  like a  a  a  and wesley  you got a  f great  i hate teachers  especially my french teacher  gaufau or something  he s a real son of a bitch  he goes around calling students stupid  telling them their dead shrimps  dont ask   and generally putting students down  especially me  he seems to hate me well  i just hate him right back  i even stopped making homework for french lessons  cause i m not learning something anyway  people at school keep calling me stupid  but people outside school seem to think about me as a potential great scientist  or sumting that style  i do nt get it  can ya really measure how smart someone is by there school grades  my life  well  i hope for you you really didnt actually read all of that  but i needed to get that all of my chest  feels good   well  now ya know how basicly my life is  i just spend my days in a deadly boring routine of sleep  school  computers  music  msn  eating and sleeping  yeah  i thought of suicide more then just once  cause i really didnt saw the point in life anymore  i also been at a soul shrink for a few weeks man i hate such people  nothing personal offcourse  i mean  she was really nice and all  but i hate it

       "[\"have an old clamshell ibook that i found on consignment . works pretty well . it was cheaper than what was being sold on ebay and those were slower models . added more memory so could upgrade os . now runs panther decently . added a bunch of games that i just trashed tonight to make more room on the hard drive ( only has 10 gigs ) . also am trying to find replacement products for the microsoft products on it . took off office and installed openoffice . use netscape and safari instead of ie . not exactly su re why i 'm doing it though . it risks screwing up my computer , but i find it a fun experiment . i am such a mac geek.m  not sure if i mentioned in a previous post , but i hate the heat . i am not a sun bunny . do n't like outdoor activities . no beach , no camping , no hiking . do n't really like to sweat . which kinda sucks since i live in hawaii . i really should be used to it , having been born and raised here , but i really do n't like the sun . i avoid the beach like the plague . i do n't even know how to swim . i always joke that it is some kind of karmic retribution for some evil deed done in a previous life . it could be . i just ca n't see myself leaving here though . i 'm doubly screwed .  seems that i 've been out of the office more than i 've been in it . pretty fun . except that i hate the sun . and it is sunny . arrrgh . what 's worse , though it is sunny , it is also slightly humid . so it is really hot . aaaaahhhhhhh .  i collect those muppet show dvd 's , y'know the ones with three episodes on each dvd . just got the one where brooke shields , diana ross , and rudolph nureyev guest . the rudolph nureyev episode is pretty funny . there is also this added scene where this muppet is singing how he is incomplete without his loved one . it is a really sweet if somewhat strange little song . y'all ( who ever happens to come across this blog ) should go out and get it . really entertaining .  my place is overun by animals . one roommate has 2 dogs . the other has 5 guppies ( used to be 6 , but one mysteriously disappeared ... ) and i have 2 rabbits . one rabbit is psycho . will have fits of energy , running around the cage in circles and jumping . the other bunny is way too lazy and is huge ... still wondering what happened to that one guppy . might have been sucked into the filter . could have also been eaten by his/her brethren . the dogs bark at sirens . and there is always a siren every 45 min . or so . aarrrgghhh  the time stamp on my blogs are off . my time zone was set for la . not that that 's bad , it 's just that i 'm in hawaii . so i 'm like 2 or so hours early for my blogs . finally fixed it though , hopefully . very odd . it 's like traveling to the philippines . just got back 2 weeks ago . left manila at 3 in the afternoon on june 12. arrived in hawaii at 7:30 in the morning on june 12. i came before i left . weird . and get your minds out of the gutter ...  i hope that 's how you spell it . but just had that for lunch . really good . had it without the round onions though , ca n't stand the after taste of round onions . green onions are fine , just not round onions . it was from jun bo . nice little hole in the wall restaurant . is behind the blood bank in downtown , down an alley way that smells of urine . of course most alley ways smell like that . alley ways and stairwells . no matter what kind of building , all the stairwells seem to smell of urine . very odd , and disgusting . but the shrimp fu yung was good . very good .  not sure why i started one . have read others . always fascinated by what others like to share . must be the inner voyeur in me . and now i 've started one for other voyeurs to see . probably be the closest thing i have to a webpage . have a domain and stuff but i 'm not putting in the time to make the webpages ... partly due to being lazy and partly to having a short attention span . darn short attention span .  that is the song by paulina rubio that i 've been obsessed with for 3 days now . heard 5 seconds of it on a commercial on vh1 and searched on yahoo for the title . paulina rubio apparently sings it . downloaded it from itunes music store and now ca n't stop playing it . but i have to play it on my ipod 'cause roommates are sick of hearing me play it on repeat . aaaahhhhhh  have an original 5 gb ipod . never upgraded 'cause was always out of budget range . now apple announced that they dropped the prices by 100 dollars . upgrading seems mighty attractive now . hmmm ...  it is friday . week went by quickly . need to bring in my car for a check up and then have an eye doctor 's appointment . that is my weekend so far . also need to finish the case modification i 'm trying out on my old g3 minitower . started to put starry night on it but stopped half way through . always a problem of mine . starting something and just lose interest half way through . oh well . i am bound and determined to finish this . hopefully .  finally decided to get a haircut yesterday . omfg , what a big f*cking mistake . i went from florence henderson flippy in the back to something that resembles a lesbian haircut ( and not a mullet ) . it is really short bit not short enough to spike 'cause my bangs are shorter than the rest of my hair . i hate the haircut lady . she was deaf and could barely speak english . aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh . in part it was my f*cking mistake to actually go ahead when i knew those factors . aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh  http : //money.cnn.com/2004/06/29/news/fortune500/mattel_barbie/index.htm her new boyfriend is australian ... it made cnn news . i am astounded . what happened to ken ? what happened to ken ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  took apart my old computer and planning to paint the plastic parts . doing the starry night by van gogh . first wanted to do it with newspapers and paper mache . now relying on pastel sticks . seems to work better than the newspaper . turning out okay . then will cover it in a clear plastic coating ... co-worker says it 's called decoupage . not sure if that is exactly the technique i 'm trying to go for but hey . sounds interesting . decoupage .  always have this fear that the white bunny , subaru , will go psycho and start to attack whenever we get near . she 's done it before . subaru seems fine now . we 've separated the two . hokuto in one cage , subaru in another . subaru apparently could n't stand the continuous humping attempts from hokuto . subaru is calmer now . will come up to your finger to be rubbed on the nose . really cute . of course it 's only because subaru wants out of the cage to hop around the living room . once out , subaru will growl at any attempt at physical contact . *sigh* psycho bunny . \"]"
